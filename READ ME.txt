Conecta 4 - Smart Computer Player
Author: Universidad de Alicante
Jugador Maquina Developer: Matthew Quintana

This program creates a "smart" machine player that determines the best move
to make based on possible moves available. By default, the algorithm can 
search down to two moves ahead, analyzing the piece placements to determine 
which move is the best to make.
